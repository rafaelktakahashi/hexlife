# Hexlife

A two-dimensional hexagonal cellular automaton, which uses different colors for
live cells in safety, live cells in danger, fertile dead cells and dead cells
that will remain dead. You can also change the rule for birth and survival.

The whole thing runs in the browser.

Cell toggling currently has a bug, and clicks don't really go where they should.
